# Root UBS Scan Baseline (2025-11-16)

Command pattern: `./ubs --format=json --ci --only=<lang> .`

| Language | Files | Critical | Warning | Info | Notes |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|------|-------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | 37 | 165 | 1,072 | 1,580 | Majority of repo footprint; likely includes modules/, test fixtures, and main CLI. Focus null safety + math categories first. |
| Python | 0 | 2 | 4 | 7 | Findings come from scripts (probably install/test harness). Need to sample files to confirm. |
| Go | 0 | 3 | 1 | 1 | Likely tooling in install script. Low count but still critical. |
| Rust | 4 | 7 | 15 | 13 | Under modules/ubs-rust; need to inspect categories (ownership/unsafe). |
| C/C++ | 4 | 7 | 5 | 7 | Targets modules/ubs-cpp.*; mostly heuristics. |
| Java | 4 | 3 | 1 | 6 | Probably scaffolding. |
| Ruby | 4 | 3 | 3 | 0 | rubocop-style issues. |

Next actions (reflected in TODO.md / Beads issue `ultimate_bug_scanner-9dk`):
1. Drill into JS output (look for category blocks: Null Safety, Math & Arithmetic, Security, etc.).
2. Create sub-issues per theme (e.g., “Clean up Null Safety findings in modules/ubs-js.sh”).
3. Repeat for other languages after JS triage.
